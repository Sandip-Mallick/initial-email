# Initial Email Outlook Add-in

An Outlook Add-in that allows you to extract the body text of a selected email, save it as a JSON file, and send it to Azure OpenAI for analysis.

## Features

- Extract email body content from the selected email in Outlook
- Save email data (subject, sender, date, body) as a JSON file
- Send email data to Azure OpenAI for analysis and summarization
- Works with Outlook Desktop (Windows/Mac) and Outlook Web

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version recommended)
- Microsoft Outlook (Desktop or Web)
- OpenSSL (for certificate generation)
- Azure OpenAI API access

## Setup for Development

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS development:
   ```
   # Create certs directory
   mkdir -p certs
   cd certs

   # Generate server key and certificate
   openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -x509 -days 365 -out server.crt -subj "/CN=localhost"

   # Create certificate serial number file
   echo "01" > ca.srl

   # Generate CA key
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

   # Generate CA certificate
   openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"

   # Return to project root
   cd ..
   ```
5. Configure Azure OpenAI credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Azure OpenAI credentials:
     ```
     AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_full_endpoint_url_here  # e.g. https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-deployment/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview
     AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Azure OpenAI Setup

1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Deploy a model in your Azure OpenAI resource (e.g., GPT-4o)
3. Get your full endpoint URL (including deployment name and API version) and API key from the Azure Portal
4. Add these credentials to your `.env` file as shown above
